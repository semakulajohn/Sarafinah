                    election process was plagued by cyber-meddling, internet infrastructure companies faced massive digital attacks that disrupted web connectivity for millions of people, and Apple faced off with the FBI in an epic privacy battle. When reality
                    is more terrifying than a movie could ever be, perhaps it's time to retreat into the fictional for awhile and enjoy the fascinating world of cybersecurity from the safety of your living room for a change. Here are some favorite movies and
                    television shows from 2016 that will let you get a taste of the hacker underworld over the holidays—hopefully without consigning you to a permanent state of digital dread. We aim high at being focused on building relationships with our clients
                    and community. Using our creative gifts drives this foundation.

                    <p>
                        Well, duh. USA's Mr. Robot is probably the most accurate and detailed dramatic portrayal ever made of current hacking practices and hacker culture. Its depiction of the cybersecurity community and its broader meditation on the relationship
                        between humans and technology isn't perfect. (Not to mention that Season 2, which aired this year, had some narrative issues.) But overall the show is compelling and full of delightful references and winks to the cybersecurity subculture.

                    <p>
                        The story of whistleblower Edward Snowden is the most dramatic spy story of the decade. An Oliver Stone biopic was inevitable. So here it is. As movies almost always do, Snowden eliminates the nuance from this complicated and controversial
                        story, painting Snowden as a hero and the National Security Agency as a one-dimensional villain. But as WIRED pointed out when the movie debuted, Snowden is important because it's the accessible version of events that many Americans will
                        remember.

                    <p>
                        It's not every day that a network drama puts the ethics and repercussions of bulk surveillance at the core of its premise, but CBS's Person of Interest managed to do it successfully. The show combines government surveillance to stop terrorist
                        attacks with an eccentric hacker billionaire and vigilante justice. It even grapples with questions of how an artificial intelligence evolves and incorporates biases. Person of Interest is particularly known for airing a prescient episode
                        in 2012 about a National Security Agency whistleblower very similar to Edward Snowden.
